                  Why Brainmate Might Occasionally Be Wrong ü§î
                </h2>
                <p className="section-text">
                  Brainmate uses natural language models that generate responses
                  based on patterns from study materials, not human reasoning.
                  This means it can sometimes misread vague or complex
                  questions, or phrase explanations imperfectly. It doesn‚Äôt
                  ‚Äúknow‚Äù information‚Äîit predicts what‚Äôs most likely correct
                  based on the data it was trained on.

                <h3 className="subsection-title">Limited Scope</h3>
                <p className="section-text">
                  Brainmate only answers <strong>question-related</strong>{" "}
                  content within the app. If you ask about unrelated subjects,
                  personal advice, or topics outside the practice questions, its
                  replies may not be reliable. It also doesn‚Äôt replace

                <h3 className="subsection-title">Variations in Input</h3>
                <p className="section-text">
                  Because everyone writes differently, Brainmate may
                  misinterpret slang, incomplete sentences, or overly technical
                  phrasing. Providing clear context helps it give better
                  answers.

                  Although Brainmate has been trained on curated educational
