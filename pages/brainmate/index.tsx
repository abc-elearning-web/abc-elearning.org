                  Studying for an exam can feel overwhelming, but you don't have
                  to do it alone anymore. Brainmate is your built-in AI
                  assistant, designed to help you understand the questions
                  inside the app and make learning smoother. Think of it as a
                  calm, knowledgeable friend who's always ready to explain
                  things and answer every answer.

                <h3 className="subsection-title">What is Brainmate?</h3>
                <p className="section-text">
                  Brainmate isn't a general chatbot that chats about
                  everythingâ€”it's focused entirely on your study content. Its
                  purpose is simple: to help you understand each question
                  deeply, recognize common traps, and strengthen your exam
                  readiness. Brainmate combines AI language understanding with
                  subject-specific knowledge to guide you whenever you're stuck.
                </p>

                <h3 className="subsection-title">How Brainmate Works</h3>
                <p className="section-text">
                  At its core, Brainmate is powered by{" "}
                  <strong>advanced AI language models</strong> (built on
                  technology similar to ChatGPT-4). When you ask a question,
                  Brainmate doesn't just search for the meaning, looks for the
                  relevant concept, and then explains it back to you in simple,
                  supportive language. Instead of just giving you the answer, it
                  helps you see <em>how</em> to reach it, so you actually learn
                  in the process.
                </p>
                <p className="section-text">
                  Brainmate can clarify confusing terms, point out why other
                  options are incorrect, offer guidance on difficult reasoning,
                  and give you extra tips related to the question and even guide
                  you through your thought process. Everything it provides stays
                  strictly within the context of your practice content.

                  Why Brainmate Might Occasionally Be Wrong ðŸ¤”
                </h2>
                <p className="section-text">
                  Brainmate uses natural language models that generate responses
                  based on patterns from extensive training and logical
                  reasoning. This means it can sometimes mislead vague or
                  complex questions, or phrase explanations imperfectly. It
                  doesn't "know" information, it predicts what's most likely
                  correct based on the data it's trained on.
                </p>

                <h3 className="subsection-title">Limited Scope</h3>
                <p className="section-text">
                  Brainmate only answers question-related content within the
                  app. If you ask about unrelated subjects, personal advice, or
                  topics outside the practice questions, its responses might not
                  be reliable. It also doesn't replace textbooks, teachers, or
                  official resourcesâ€”use those sources to confirm important
                  details.
                </p>

                <h3 className="subsection-title">Variations in Input</h3>
                <p className="section-text">
                  Because everyone writes differently, Brainmate may
                  misunderstand slang, incomplete sentences, or overly technical
                  phrasing. Providing clear context helps it give better
                  answers.
                </p>

                <h3 className="subsection-title">Data Limitations</h3>
                <p className="section-text">
                  Although Brainmate has been trained on curated educational
                  content, some explanations might feel outdated or biased
                  depending on the source materials. It doesn't access real-
                  time databases or the most up-to-date, confidential data.
                </p>

                <h3 className="subsection-title">Continuous Improvement</h3>
                <p className="section-text">
                  Our team is constantly refining Brainmate's responses through
                  updates and user feedback. If something seems off, it's
                  helping us know. Every message helps Brainmate become a more
