                                <p>Mentora is built on advanced natural language processing models like GPT-4, which have been trained on vast amounts of text data. However, it does not "think" or "understand" like a humanâ€”it predicts words and phrases based on patterns rather than genuine comprehension. This means:</p>

                                <p>Mentora does not replace external resources, such as official textbooks, real-world expert advice, or professional consultations.</p>
                                <p>If a topic is outside its training data, it may try to generate a response based on similar concepts, which can lead to inaccuracies.</p>
