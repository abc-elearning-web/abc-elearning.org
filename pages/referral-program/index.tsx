                        Thank you for being an essential part of our community! Our Referral Program is designed to reward users who
                        help grow our community by inviting their friends to join our app. Both you (the Referrer) and your friends (the
                        Referees) will receive special benefits for participating.

                                <li>The Referee downloads the app using your unique link or code.</li>
                                <li>The Referee signs up and logs into their account using the email address you entered, and has never
                                    used the app before.</li>
                                <li>The Referee completes their very first Daily Challenge in the app.</li>
